# yapscan ![build status](https://github.com/fkie-cad/yapscan/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/fkie-cad/yapscan/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=Y2ANV37QH6)](https://codecov.io/gh/fkie-cad/yapscan) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/fkie-cad/yapscan)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/fkie-cad/yapscan)

Yapscan is a **YA**ra based **P**rocess **SCAN**ner, aimed at giving more control about what to scan and giving detailed reports on matches.

**The report format is now versioned and a stable version 1.1.0 is released with compatibility guarantees, see the [report format documentation](report/v1.1.0/README.md).**

## Features

You can use yapscan to selectively scan the memory of running processes as well as files in local hard drives and/or mounted shares.
The most notable differences to stock yara are (see section [Usage](#usage)),

- Supports loading yara-rules from an encrypted zip file to prevent anti-virus software from detecting rules as malicious.
- Multiple yara rules can also be loaded recursively from a directory. 
- Can suspend processes to be scanned (use with care, may crash your system).
- Allows for filtering of memory segments to be scanned based on size, type (image, mapped, private), state (commit, free, reserve), and permissions.
- Allows for easy scanning of all running processes, local drives and/or mounted shares.
- Comes with extensive reporting features to allow later analysis of efficacy of rules.
- Matched memory segments can even be automatically dumped and stored as part of the 

Other quality-of-life features include

- Statically built, dependency free exe for Windows
- Listing running processes
- Listing and dumping memory segments of a specific process
- Compiling yara rules and compressing them into an encrypted zip.
- Provides an "executable DLL" for locked down environments such as VDIs (see section [Executable DLL](#executable-dll))
- Anonymization of reports with either a predefined, or a randomly generated salt

Yapscan comes with support for both Windows and Linux, however Windows is the primary and most thoroughly tested target OS.

# Enable logging, reporting and auto dumping of matched segments
yapscan --log-level debug --log-path yapscan.log scan -r rules.zip --full-report --store-dumps --all-processes
```

## Running as Service

Yapscan can be run as a windows service in order to gain SYSTEM privileges.
This allows you to crash even other windows services, using the crash command.
Running as service is currently an **experimental feature**.

For memory scanning this should not be necessary.
In my experiments it has been sufficient to run yapscan as administrator in order to read the memory of any process.
If you find a process that yapscan cannot scan with administrator privileges but that can be scanned as a service, please let me know in the [issues](https://github.com/fkie-cad/yapscan/issues/new).

In order to use yapscan as a service just prepend the `as-service` command to the command (and flags) you wish to execute.
Example:

```shell
# Normal mode
.\yapscan.exe crash 42
# Service mode
.\yapscan.exe as-service crash 42
```

The output of the windows service is transmitted to the terminal via two TCP connections.
If this breaks a warning will be emitted.
In such a case the service may still be running, you just won't see any output.
Also CTRL-C will break the proxy command, preventing you from seeing any output, but will not affect the running service.
If you want to kill the service, you'll have to use the windows service manager for now.

## Executable DLL

**The DLL built by this project is not a usual DLL, meant for importing functions from.**
Instead it acts similarly to the exe with two exported, high-level entry points:

```C
// start acts same as you would expect a main function to act.
// It assumes a terminal with stdout/stderr and stdin has already
// been allocated.
extern int start(int argc, char** argv);

// run is meant for use with rundll32.
// It opens a new console window via AllocConsole(), then parses the
// lpCmdLine to extract the arguments and calls starts yapscan
// with the extracted arguments. 
extern void run(HWND hWnd, HINSTANCE hInst, LPTSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow);
```

Some environments like VDIs (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) may prevent the execution of arbitrary exe-files but still allows for use of arbitrary DLLs.
If you gain access to a command line terminal in such an environment you can call yapscan via the built DLL like so.

```shell
rundll32.exe yapscan.dll,run scan -r rules.zip --all-processes
```  

**NOTE**: This feature is still experimental!
There very likely are quirks with the argument parsing. 

## State of this project

**BETA, FeatureFreeze**

Right now yapscan is in a beta period.
I am currently working on a stable 1.0 release.
This release will have a defined and documented stable API and cli interface that will remain backwards compatible for all 1.x versions.
Before releasing 1.0 I also want to have at least a reasonable amount of test-coverage.

Feel free to use and test it and open issues for any bugs you may find.
If you would like to have some additional features you can also open an issue with a feature request, but until the 1.0 release I will not be working on or merging any new features.

## Contributing

Found a bug or want a feature, but you can't code or don't have the time?
Feel free to open an issue! Please look for duplicates first.

If you want to contribute code, be it fixes or features, please open a pull request **on the develop branch** and mention any related issues.

In the rapid-development phase I have only used the master branch, but will switch very shortly to the [git-flow workflow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.html).
This means the master branch will represent the latest stable release at any point in time and any work-in-progress is to be merged into the develop branch.

## Scanning Technique

The actual scanning is left to the yara library.
In case of file scanning, the high level yara library function `yr_rules_scan_file` is used.
This function memory-maps the given file.
Scanning process memory, on the other hand, is done on a lower level.
Yapscan copies one memory segment at a time into a buffer in its own memory and then uses `yr_rules_scan_mem` in order to scan this buffer.

## Building Yapscan

To build **natively on Linux**, for Linux you need install Go and the yara library.
Once you have installed the dependencies it's as easy as:

```bash
# Install Golang and libyara
git clone https://github.com/fkie-cad/yapscan
cd yapscan/cmd/yapscan
go build
```

If you want to build on Linux for Windows, all you need installed is docker.

```bash
# Install docker
git clone https://github.com/fkie-cad/yapscan
cd yapscan/cicd/
./crossBuildForWindows.sh
```

The resulting binaries will be placed in `cicd/build/`.

Building **natively on Windows**, using MSYS2 follow these instructions

1. Install Go
2. Install MSYS2 and follow the first steps on [the MSYS2 Website] of updating via pacman.
3. Install build dependencies `pacman --needed -S base-devel git autoconf automake libtool mingw-w64-{x86_64,i686}-{gcc,make,pkgconf}`
4. Open PowerShell in the `cicd/` directory and execute `.\buildOnWindows.ps1 -MsysPath <msys_path> -BuildDeps`
   where `<msys_path>` is the install directory for MSYS2, default is `C:\msys64`.
   **NOTE:** You'll have to press `Enter` on the MSYS window, once the dependencies are finished.
5. Enjoy the built files in `cicd/build/`

If you want to run tests on Windows, you have to run `.\cicd\buildOnWindows.ps1 -BuildDeps` only once.
Then you open PowerShell and execute `.\cicd\enableMingw.ps1 -MsysPath <msys_path>` to set the appropriate environment variables.
Now it's as easy as `go test -tags yara_static ./...`.
The `-tags yara_static` is necessary if you use the build scripts, as they do not install any windows DLLs but only the static libraries.

**NOTE:** You might get inexplicable failures with `-race` on Windows.
According to the [golang release notes for 1.14](https://golang.org/doc/go1.14#compiler), the new pointer arithmetic checks are somewhat overzealous on Windows.
In Golang v1.15 it seems this may not have been fixed, but the checks are enabled automatically.
You can deactivate them like this `go test -tags yara_static -race -gcflags=all=-d=checkptr=0 ./...`.

You don't have to rely on the powershell/bash scripts, but they are intended to make things as easy as possible at the cost of control over the compilation.
If you want more control, take a look at the scripts use and modify them or execute the commands individually.
The scripts perform the following tasks.

1. Start "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit"
    1. Download OpenSSL from github
    2. Static-Build OpenSSL and install the development files
    3. Download libyara from github
    4. Static-Build libyara and install it
2. Set some environment variables in powershell, to allow the use of the mingw toolchain
3. Call the `go build` command with the appropriate build tag for static builds

Thanks to [@hillu] (author of [go-yara]), for pointing me in the right direction for building natively on windows.
